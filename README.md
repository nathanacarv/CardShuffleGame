This Windows Forms application is a card-shuffling game where both the user and the computer receive three randomly dealt cards from a virtual deck. 
The program tracks each card's value, displays the dealt cards, and calculates the total score for each player. 
After dealing, it announces the winner or declares a tie. 
Start by clicking the "Deal" button to play a round, and exit the game using the "Exit" button.
